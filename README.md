The technologies used to create the webpage are: Javascript
                                                 API from OpenLibrary and Google
                                                 HTML, CSS
                                                 GitHub
                                                 IDE: VS Code

The strategy we implemented:
A basic abstract or idea was sketched  on how the webpage would look like. We explored the various technologies and concepts to be used in this project. Next, it was time to get started so we used HTML and CSS
to design the main page. Further, API's from OpenLibrary and Google were used. We provided two methods to search: (i) By title and (ii) By ISBN.
By using HTML: We began building the webpages by creating their basic structure using HTML. We divided the content into sections such as the header, search bar, book display area, and footer.
then the styling with CSS: We applied the visual design using CSS. We incorporated the chosen color palette, typography, and layout styles to create a visually appealing and coherent interface.

Next to make the project functional, JavaScript Functionality:
Book Search: We developed a JavaScript function that handled book searches based on their titles. We integrated the Open Library API to fetch relevant book data and displayed it dynamically on the page.
ISBN Search: For a broader scope, we created a function to retrieve book details using ISBN numbers from the Google Books API. This data was structured and displayed to users

Finally after numerous testing and trials, we arrived at a conclusion. After which we uploaded our project to the GitHub repository > vpt-2023-aug--NitinS-.

The future scopes of this project includes designing a login system, a collection of "my books", a homepage where the popular books are displayed and so on.
